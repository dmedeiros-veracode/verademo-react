# Verademo React Application for Azure DevOps

## Project Description

This application repository was created to illustrate how to properly use Veracode Analysis tools within the a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The examples illustrated here utilize the concept of separation of concerns for CI/CD administration.

The Verademo application example is a simple .NET Core web application with a Angular Front End. In this example both the front end content and simple back end content are bother submitted to the same application portfolio. In a larger application these should be further distributed out into more application portfolios.

>[!NOTE]
>The demo application does not have any major weaknesses or vulnerabilities reported within the main branch. As the purpose of this project is to illustrate integration of the Veracode Tools.

# Pipeline Examples

The examples for the pipelines within the main line branch are only a demonstration of a successful path through the SDLC in each case. The Verademo application within this branch does not container any weaknesses or vulnerabilities to demonstrate any strategy.

# Setup and Usage

#### SAST Plarform/Sandbox Analysis
In the Azure Domain Settings under Service Connection create a Veracode Analysis Center Service Connection. Configure with appropriate Veracode API ID and Veracode API Key.

#### SAST Pipeline Analysis
Create in the Azure Project Library a library group that is called "Veracode Credentials". Configure the variable group to contain two secret variables:
- VERACODE_API_ID
- VERACODE_API_KEY

#### SCA Agent
SRCCLR_API_TOKEN Set to the token value
